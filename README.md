### Project Summary
This project was a grocery-tracking program written in C++. It solves the problem of tracking how many times grocery items are bought by customers. The program lets the user search for items, shows how often each item is bought, creates a text-based histogram, and backs up data to a file. It uses maps, file input/output, and simple menus to make it easy for anyone to use.

### What I Did Well
I think I did a really good job organizing my code and using maps to handle the grocery data. I made sure the user menu was simple and easy to understand. I also made sure the program automatically created a backup file when it starts, without needing the user to do anything.

### Where I Could Improve
I could make my code more efficient by cleaning up some of the if-else logic and maybe using functions a little more to avoid repeating similar code. Breaking up the program even more would make it easier to update in the future. I could also add more error checking for user input, which would make it more secure and less likely to crash.

### Challenges and How I Overcame Them
The hardest part was reading the data from the input file and loading it correctly into the map. At first, the map wasn't updating counts the right way. I had to double-check how .find() and map indexing work in C++. I used the C++ documentation and watched a couple short videos on maps to help fix it.

### Skills I Can Transfer
This project helped me a lot with working with file input and output, which is super common in real-world programs. I also got better at using C++ maps and working with user menus, which will definitely help in future projects or courses.

### How I Made the Program Maintainable
I made sure to add comments throughout the code so itâ€™s easy to follow even if someone else is reading it. I also made the code modular, like using a separate function to create the histogram. If someone wanted to update or add features later, it would be pretty easy to do.
